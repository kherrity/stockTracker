Description:
------------
This is a (rudimentary) stock tracker application written in Python.
You enter a comma separated list of stocks you're interested in tracking, your cell phone number, and a percentage increase threshold, 
and you will be sent SMS text alerts on the hour if any of the stocks you listed rises above the threshold. 

Notes:
------
If using py2exe to create an executable, in Windows, need to run:
C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py py2exe

If you run the executable (st_gui.exe), you'll likely get an exeption: pytz.UnknownTimeZoneError
The __init__.py script needs to be modified slightly for pytz (C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pytz\__init__.py).
